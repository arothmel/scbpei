A Drupal 6 site that does not work with PHP 5.4

What a great method to move a project from one machine to another!
Stay tuned while I do some clean-up before preparing to migrate to Drupal 7

Note: Drupal 6 requires PHP 4.4, but should work on all newer versions. If it doesn't, that's a bug which should be fixed. That is if you don't use any contrib modules :P
